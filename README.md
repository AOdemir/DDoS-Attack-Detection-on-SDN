# DDoS-Attack-Detection-on-SDN
Long Term Project on SDN with Cyber Security comprehension using Data Science techniques.

The main purpose of this project is to achieve further improvemnets with AI models in network environment using OpenFlow protocol to have an organised and secure data traffic for the means of Cyber Security. Public datasets have been projected under certain types of Machine Learning models with Neural Networks. Future projections are being prepared for making a real-life equivalent and with complex environmental elements of network dataflows which is essential to test the performance of AI models and develope the architecture.
