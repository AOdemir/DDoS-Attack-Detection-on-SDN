# DDoS-Attack-Detection-on-SDN
Long Term Project on SDN with Cyber Security comprehension using Data Science techniques.

Main purpose of the project is to achieve further improvemnets with AI models in network environment using OpenFlow(SDN) protocol to have an organised and secure data traffic for the means of Cyber Security. Public datasets are beening projected under certain types of Machine Learning models including Neural Networks. Future projections are being prepared for making a real-life equivalent including complex environmental elements of network traffics which is essential to test the performance of AI models and develope the architecture.
